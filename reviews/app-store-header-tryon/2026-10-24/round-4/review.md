# Critic: app-store-header-tryon, round 4 (2026-10-24)

Render: `renders/app-store-header-tryon/master/15s/app-store-header-tryon_master_store-header_15s_v4.mp4` (sha256 `da1eae1b3ed58ce7…`), 1920×822, 60 fps, 15.00 s.

**Judge only the rendered frames below, never the code.** Score 1–10; 8+ on every line passes the round.

## Evidence

| File | What to look at |
|---|---|
| `contact.jpg` | the whole film at 2 fps: one focal point per beat? anything cluttered, off-brand, empty? |
| `strip.jpg`, `strip-zoom.jpg` | the fastest move (5.15 s, 24.1 px/frame): one smear, or copies? comb **0.042**, sample gap **0.9 px** (≤ 3 px or it echoes) → **clean** |
| `phone.jpg` | 360 px wide: can every word be read in the time it's up? |
| `loop.mp4`, `seam.jpg` | the loop seam: diff 0.53 vs a normal step 0.02 → **seamless** |
| `audio.wav`, `waveform.png` | the blindfold test: structure visible without picture? strong onsets on the beat grid: **None** |

## Measured

- Determinism: frame 309 rendered twice → DIFFERENT
- Loudness: None LUFS integrated (FAIL: −14 ± 1), true peak None dBTP (FAIL: ≤ −1)
- Holds ≥ 0.5 s: 0.0–1.87 s, 3.62–4.15 s, 4.18–4.85 s, 6.3–8.32 s, 8.35–10.6 s, 12.77–13.58 s, 13.62–14.98 s (an end card SHOULD hold ≥ 2 s; elsewhere a hold must be a read)
- Cuts: none · layer drops: none

## Scores (1–10)

| Criterion | What an 8 looks like | Score |
|---|---|---|
| Hook in 2 s | By 2.0 s a stranger knows what this is about and wants the next second. One clear image, no warm-up. | _ |
| Phone readability | At 360 px wide every word on screen is readable in the time it is up; one focal point per beat. | _ |
| Motion smoothness | No echo, judder, pops or dead stops; moves have mass; the fastest move's strip shows one smear, not copies. | _ |
| Variety | Each beat earns its place with a different idea; nothing repeats without a reason; no template look. | _ |
| Sound sync | Blindfolded, the waveform alone shows the structure: hits on the moves, big moments on downbeats, -14 LUFS. | _ |
| Brand accuracy | Monochrome ramp, Geist, the real app, the logo untouched, the rules in RULES.md; the CTA readable for 2 s+. | _ |

## The 3 worst defects

| # | Time | Evidence (file + what you see) | Local fix (the smallest change that fixes it) |
